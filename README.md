# My-Project1NC
A sleek and responsive Netflix-inspired landing page built with modern front-end technologies. Focused on clean UI/UX design, smooth layout, and pixel-perfect styling to replicate the look and feel of Netflix’s homepage.
This project is a Netflix Clone – Landing Page that I built to practice and showcase my front-end development and UI/UX design skills. It recreates the look and feel of Netflix’s homepage, focusing on responsive design, modern layouts, and a clean user experience.

The landing page highlights:
🎨 UI/UX Design – Pixel-perfect styling inspired by Netflix’s interface.
📱 Responsive Layout – Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
⚡ Modern Front-End Tech – Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or the tools you used).
🖥️ Immersive Experience – Hero sections, banners, and content rows that mirror Netflix’s design.
While this is not a full-stack app with video playback or authentication, it serves as a frontend showcase project that demonstrates my ability to design and code real-world, visually appealing landing pages.
